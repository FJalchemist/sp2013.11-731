the european monetary union was severely undermined european debt crisis in recent months .

anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows .

" such a strong reduction , so , make most of our projects кораблестроению repressions and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "

a cursory glance at recent headlines shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .

stories of fraud on exams at school and college - standard deal .
mentors who must teach opposite , sent a message that lies and fraud finds acceptable .
in a single day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another survey showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes get acquainted with each other .
unlike game room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " detection of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities in comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not worth from doing this conclusion that liars difficult note and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , examining the scientific discoveries of the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts that men are more lie about themselves , while women -- about others , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in speech : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky ... " or repeat a complex question completely .
someone might use " qualification " language , when answering a difficult question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... how i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

рафаель эррера , researcher chemical faculty unam , developed polymer - modified bitumen , to produce a mix of the best quality , sustainable exposed to the environment and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , under the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to bitumen production , but with the best resistance both high and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his характерное вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that resistance street asphalt is not permanent , and varies throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said specializing in chemical engineering .
among the most of the upper layers is bitumen compiled from small stones , опущенных bitumen and then спрессованных .
when vehicles and latch efforts , it helps forces very well be on the road covering .
on асфальтовом cover , he added , placed last layer , called a layer of wear , which is made of small stone in fact , sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , layer wear also requires the proper thickness , and must be taken into account material from which he is .
when the earth crude , water into coverage and it 's impossible to leave , it raises размягчение all sectors of the cover , and therefore education yam .
also a member of the national researchers explained that transport system load is another important factor in the formation of holes , and so each layer thickness cover should always be connected to transport load and need to ensure this requirement , to prevent the frequent appearance of yam .

from hs28-0712 delegates only nine voted against and ten abstained .
the basic idea of the chancellor and a draft resolution expresses the slogan : the answer to crisis - " not less europe , but more europe . "
in any case , it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution , adopted by congress , an idea , obviously , belongs to вольфгангу schaeuble .
wanting to calm the situation in his party , the chancellor has increased its number of references to the konrad adenauer and helmut kohl , but she was not sought to influence congress at the expense of " small " european countries or , in a precarious position that love to criticize the " arrogant " germany .

following the monetary benefits , ump and the government began an attack on the hospital sheets .
and to help this наступлению , sprang from a desire to save in a difficult situation , but also составляющему part of a right on presidential re - election campaign , the majority wants to concentrate on hospital sheets .
obviously , without the consent of the employer , the ill worker will lose the salary for four days , equal to at least 15 % of his / her monthly income .
and that will be accompanied by other measures with more than symbolic effect , namely to impose state employees one day without paying the sickness ( public servants still did n't have to wait for payment , unlike the three - day expectations of private - sector workers ) .
control will become more tight , and in addition , if you get caught , you must return all illegally received payments , " xavier bertrand warned the rtl channel on saturday 13 november .
they really are permanent control since 2002 and political attacks , which bring fruit .
according to the research and documentation of health economics institute , the daily compensation expenses in 2008 , thousands of 11.3 million euros accounted for 5 percent of total health spending .
arithmetic , which hides some deviation ; another study , published in 2007 , the site about career management , monster.com , found that 75 % of 40,000 french workers surveyed said that they did n't take a single day of the hospital .
if these figures compare with figures european neighbors , it seems that french workers , no more inclined to take sick than workers of any other country .
levels of fraud related to sick leave , very low compared to " grey " employment .
stricter law since 2002 led to systematic проверке hospital lasting more than 45 days .
in the case of systematically проверяемых hospital sheets for more than 45 days from 1.2 million 11 % were " inappropriate or unfounded " , equivalent to 132 000 .

canadians are denied death , says the royal society of canada report
this is one of the royal society 's findings , canada , which involved six experts from different areas , including the ethics , law and medicine .
for starters , experts cite a recent study of the economic expert bureau which сравнило quality of death in 40 countries around the world .
from - behind медикализации or not , but 77 % of the canadians do not have access to palliative care , according to experts appointed by the royal society of canada .

and 66 % believe that legalizing euthanasia would not signal that life elderly or disabled is less valuable .
as for the extension or termination of medical care , the situation is less than , say the authors report .

some experts in the field of legislation , associated with health care , have already expressed concerns regarding detention experts report of the royal society of canada .
this opens the door for the situation , where anyone tired of life and who more than 18 years , can ask for help in committing suicide , says meter дешан , who yesterday discussed summary of the report .
he said that " in society there are warning signs and prohibitions . "
margaret сомервилль , which itself is a member of the royal society of canada , argues , in particular , the data report relating to abuse in some countries , where euthanasia and suicide with outside help legalized , as in the netherlands and oregon .

insee , despite this , revised reduction figures in the second quarter , with 0.1 % fall in gross domestic product ( gdp ) instead of stagnation .
germany , in turn , documented the growth of 0.5 % for the same period .
if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a very short discussion or under the influence of emotions , is energy policy .
this healthy trend that the election meetings are an occasion for reflection on share and place their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production , not forgetting the constantly critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is why germany is one in its decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , is only a few of those who decisively continues his projects .
although german model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy price for energy is a key factor in competitiveness and service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that most french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a whole плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved into another industry .
any engineer - electrician will order epr , calculated to work 60 years old , if the planned closure of its maker ?
development of low - carbon solutions by areva , nuclear and renewable energy , testifies взаимодополнимости sources .
in france we have security agency , which monitors existing edged and transparent energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years atomic industry experienced three serious incident .
in the chernobyl reactor device and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .
nuclear industry извлечет lessons from this accident as the learned from the previous two .
as he viewed all specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , will halt its construction in фламанвиле gorgeous gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь to conquer leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when interior minister ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) said that france " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration burden to the french economy and for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as remind us economists ian goldin and jeffrey cameron in a recent book , обобщившей past data on immigration ( special people : how migration shaped our world and will determine our future , may 2011 , at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
influenced by fears of immigrants based on the view that they can replace the local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - dynamic sectors , where learning are not connected with the proposals work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in a country where there is a shortage анестезиологов , complementarity , between local and immigrants that the arrival of the immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus costs ) an average of 150,000 euros .
referred teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is a valuable acquisition ; but both fragile .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over its enemies , a vote and make it enough so direct as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become the " tool of suppression " , as once - republican philosopher etienne said вашро .
the european crisis that we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but this primarily a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
no , we are dreaming not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and constant - choice and democracy , this time on level .
the entire europe subject to dictates markets and rating agencies , suffers from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about transfer europe , but the whole europe gradually loses its sovereignty , and with each of her nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a long discussion of this proposal socialists and jacques delors now require all european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
