the asia can be protected , to a certain extent , but it would not be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was heavily undermined by the european debt crisis management in the last few months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything , that will be able to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and the reduction of foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious challenges , and we need to maintain a high level of economic growth " .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers on monday in congress , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and will cause financial chain reaction from the pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and the civil assembly .
" the consequences of these reductions will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to the senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong contraction , the majority of our projects on кораблестроению and construction of unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and will do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes will undermine the credibility of those who support our forces and will seriously damage the combat readiness . "
" although the military financing in the foreign emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" the staff personnel will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям with payments military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be compromised . "
" the consequence of the sequestration in the ministry of defense will become the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we can live together , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . '
whether a letter to panetta or the latest warning senators will lead to budget compromise or strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from reductions , will see later .

" this is a paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in their own introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles , including those that have already been undergoing tests , and only some of the early stages of planning .

a cursory glance at recent headlines demonstrates how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in their everyday lives .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations , during the campaign , connected with the укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud charges on the exams in school and college - this is business as usual .
coaches , who should be taught the opposite , sending a message that lies and cheating are appropriate .
during one of the day , studies have shown that , then you can lie from the 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that the strangers солгали nearly three times in the first 10 minutes and get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent several years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about the lies , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn how to identify lies - and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- particularly if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than the unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
observe behind the asphyxia , the laughter , voice characteristics in your facility .
rats can capture the upper part of his body , when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , to change its position in a certain way or to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- is this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with that woman miss lewinsky " or to repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone might use the " qualification language " , when responding to a complicated question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magical means , to expose the lies , but of deception detection to master the skill can be .

first fear is this is the restriction of the borders , where it is possible to build .
" we need to think about the new urban planning , because current instruments [ with regard to the general capital plan ( gsp ) ] may lead to the real trouble . "
модоло recalls that there are already work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss deaf ears , " even though he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " from the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which specifies the name of this part of the complex , because the rules of the competition lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountains , but there are no longitudinal - reading to see and understand the region as a whole . "
on the other hand , the project for some , the gate could overlap on the programme and identifying with the project architect for the neighboring gate .

in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible , is developing polymer - modified bitumen for mixed with characteristics of the close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both in high and low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the most difficult part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his характерное вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said specialist in the field of chemical engineering .
among the most of the upper layers is bitumen , compiled by the small stones , опущенных in the bitumen and then the спрессованных .
when vehicles and прикладывании efforts , it helps forces of very well be on the road to cover .
the асфальтовом cover , he added , put the latest layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made out of the small stone , in fact , the sand also immersed in the asphalt .
as part of pavement , which will receive and distribute these efforts , a layer of wear also requires the proper thickness , and it is necessary to take into consideration the material , from which he is .
when the earth crude , water seeps into the body coverage and finds it difficult to go from there , this is размягчение all sections of the coverage and , therefore , education , yam .

between the magazine , journalist guido ойос кромос believes that representatives of the valle de cauca error was that she has undergone major surgery .
her body has never been to her advantage , and here , she had been penalised for it .

if there is a topic , the decision on which cannot be taken after a very short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france needs to build their own opinion on the objective facts and on the rational of data .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production all the time , not forgetting about the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalances - theme , which has disappeared from the environmental debate .
that 's one reason why germany remains alone in the decision to abandon the nuclear energy .
on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil , are only a few of those who vigorously continues to their projects .
although the model of germany , based on the renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality contradicts this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , she as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they have no objection in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it has been attracting a contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved to the other industry .
one engineer and electrician will become the order epr , calculated to operate sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
development of areva and low - carbon solutions , nuclear and renewable energy , testifies to взаимодополнимости energy sources .
security in france , we have the authority , which carries out , too , and transparent control existing energy centers , such as фламанвиль .
in 50 years ago the nuclear industry has endured three serious security incident .
device in chernobyl reactor and непростительная human error has led to the tragedy .
the nuclear industry will extract the lessons from this accident , as learned from the two of previous ones .
as he is considered all the specialists in the field of energy to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then the administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news release , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , he said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
immigration on both sides of the see the burden for the french economy and for the french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected to the proposals work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity that exists between local and immigrants , leads to the arrival of immigrants that positively influences the salaries of local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among the american nobel laureates high proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - all were founded immigrants ) .
according to the international labour organisation , in germany , for example , immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
mentioned teeth , which was used only to scare immigrants , have given exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is the most valuable acquisition ; but while simultaneously and the fragile .
some believed that democracy had finally triumphed over their enemies , is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , even though and is a necessary condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as when something republican philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , that we are experiencing , " this is an economic crisis , but first and foremost , this political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referendums , organized by the necessary and хаотическом procedure .
there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
all of europe entirely is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , is suffering from their weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but the whole of europe completely gradually loses its sovereignty , and together with each of its nations .
because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this socialist proposals and jacques delors now require all of the european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary " create a " republican administration .
this can be done only through the establishment of a more democratic europe on the political level of this popular european sovereignty .

analysis of the place calls , has pointed out several находившихся in mali , niger and nigeria .
" this is a step forward , but there is no doubt that we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before the talk about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from outside and that it is becoming more and more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigeria researcher .
the international community , headed by the washington now puts pressure on абуджу , they pay attention to the problems that creates the boko haram .
she targeted mainly in the of the church , bars and the law enforcement authorities .
in the past christmas day she took responsibility for the diluted earnings per share as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then again for one in abuja .
in the august local representation in the organization of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab operating in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to the continent .
whether weakened by the crisis america can lead a complicated world with the help of the ordinary , or rather simplistic ideas ?
already a few days , mitt romney , the distance kain , rick perry and other множат loud , but without details of the statements on the foreign policy , which are traditionally a strong republican party .
mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from the " good old party , " has threatened to take on the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration as much as its industries in asia .
john huntsman , former president obama 's ambassador in china and the only candidate , the complicated foreign policy , could not overcome position , that appeasing emotions .
but the huntsman , who has been in the bottom of the ratings , has remained in неуслышанным .
romney also promised the military strikes against iran , if sanctions will not be able to halt its nuclear weapons program .
" if barack obama will be re - elected , they have a will be the bomb . "
entrepreneur distance kane , the second in the rankings candidates demonstrated обескураживающее ignorance of cases .
the texas governor rick perry , which supports israel and is committed to the military strikes on iran , says that he 's willing to use the american army against drug cartels in mexico .
all of this is very far from the republican presidential candidate john mccain 's 2008 year , тяжеловеса foreign policies .
they remind us that obama himself was amateur , and that he had to reduce the tone in the respect of the fight against terror .
after iraq is that it does not believe in military intervention that увязают in the sand .

these two countries will lose part of his authority : they will become more difficult to influence on russia , by threatening to shut down access to western european markets .

" in case of an accident we close the flow of natural gas , however , more than one minute , " said jens mueller .
but this seems unlikely that piping designers stitches , calculated on протечку only once in 100 000 years old .
сигароообразный аппарат introduced a 1 - meter diameter pipeline inside and pushed forward the flow of gas .
natural gas pipeline was designed for working for 50 years without the need for any maintenance and repairs .

then gazprom gave the company in the lease at the twenty - years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation .
gas pipeline construction financing was provided on the 30 percent of shareholders and 70 percent of bank credit .
