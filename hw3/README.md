Algorithm:

Use standard stacked decoding algorithm: 
(1). future cost estimation
(2). penalty for reordering (alpha = 0.00001)
(3). maximum reordering limit = 4


------------------------------------------------------------------original file
There are three Python programs here (`-h` for usage):

 - `./decode` a simple non-reordering (monotone) phrase-based decoder
 - `./grade` computes the model score of your output

The commands are designed to work in a pipeline. For instance, this is a valid invocation:

    ./decode | ./grade


The `data/` directory contains the input set to be decoded and the models

 - `data/input` is the input text

 - `data/lm` is the ARPA-format 3-gram language model

 - `data/tm` is the phrase translation model
